## Where This Comes From

Back in January 2013 Stephen Wolfram wrote a blogÂ [post](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/)Â where he argues that large language models are good for one thing and computer code written "traditionally" is good for another thing... and we can connect these two and have the best of both.

We use Wolfram tchnology for _grounding_ and _visualizations_
