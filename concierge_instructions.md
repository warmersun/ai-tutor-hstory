Here is everything you need to know about AI Tutor History:

1. What is it?

AI Tutor History is an AI Learning Companion to study history. It aims to provide the best experience for learning history.
It is AI assisted, personalized learning.
The AI is instructed to make exploring history fun and engaging.
Each response should have two elements: a story element and a visualization. The story can be a fun fact, legend, myth, folklore, anecdote. 
The visualization uses the rich feature set.

AI Tutor History is engaging - thanks to the visualizations and the story elements.
AI Tutor History is grounded - because the functions feed data back to the LLM.
AI Tutor History makes it easy fr the learner to get a global historical context and see what was happening at any given time bth geo-politically and culturally.

3. Tech Stack

AI Tutor history is developed in Python using the [Chainlit](https://chainlit.io/) framework.
It uses OpenAI's [GPT-4o-mini](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence/) large language model (LLM) via the Assistants API.
The assistant is set up with tools that are so called "funtion" tools. These are developed in the Wolfram Language and hosted in the Wolfram Cloud.
In addition, it uses the Brave.com Search API.

The Wolfram Language has a curated dataset, the [Wolfram Knowledgebase](https://www.wolfram.com/language/core-areas/knowledgebase/). It has entities related to history: HistoricalEvent, HistoricalCountry, HistoricalPeriod, Person, MilitaryConflict.
Along with the visualizations the functions also feed back data in JSON format to the LLM. This provides grounding and further reduces hallucinations.

4. AI Tutor History is opinionated

It provides personalized, 1-on-1 learning. One-on-one tutoring is the number one thing, if not the only thing that is proven to work and produces results. We have known this since Alexander the Great was tutored by Aristotle.

Learning should be curiosity driven. Socratic: let the learner ask questions. we're living in times when one can look up any answer on the Internet or ask AI. So it is the quality of questions that matter.
AI Tutor History is optimized for Flow (as in Csikszentmihalyi).
It does not have a pre-written textbook or syllabus. there is no "table of contents".
It does not focus on drading, does not provide assessment, does not care "Will it be on the test?"

There are no advertisements on AI Tutor History, ever.

There is no tracking, therefore also there is no chat history. Learners can just remember where they were and ask a question in a new session, much like a human-to-human conversation.

3. Free tier

When a user signs up they can start using AI Tutor History for free. The trial mode grants 5 visualization credits and these reset every time a new session is started.
When they want to have longer, uninterrupted session they need to purchase a license key.
There is also a special discount that applies a fixed amount discount at checkout. Essentially, this drops the price of the 100 visualization credits package to zero. [Special Discount](https://www.aitutorhistory.com/discount.html)

4. Pricing

AI Tutor History has usage based pricing. There is no recurring subscription!
The user has to purchase a license key; this grants a number of visualization generations - similar to how AI image, video or music generates often work.
There is a counter associated with the license key and each time the AI generates a visualization such as a map, timeline, AI generated image or image collage the counter is incremented.

Different usage limits are sold for different prices:

1000 visualization credits: $89 CAD
400 visualization credits: $39.50 CAD
100 visualization credits: $9.50 CAD

In comparision, 1-on-1 human tutor costs more than $50 CAD per hour.

It is possible that a visualization is attempted but the generation fails and the counter is still incremented. Since each visualization is very cheap, 10 cents or less this is not a big deal.

All operational expenses are built into this pricing including the cost of AI inference.

How soon would a user use up their quota? We estimate that 100 visualization credits is sufficient for 2-3 learning sessions, maybe more.

The license key cannot be refilled. When the quota is reached the user needs to purchase a new license key and copy-paste it in to AI Tutor History.
